Maximum likelihood fit of a SIR epidemiological model using MATLAB using fminsearch function. Requires manual download of the latest Apple mobility trends data as a csv (give it todays date). The Apple data is used as a regressor to predict the transmission rate in the model. 

Run sir_nyc_mobility_t0_DOH.m to fit the model to the latest data (downloaded live from the NYCDOH).
